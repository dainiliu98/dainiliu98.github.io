            <h2>Who are you?</h2>
            <hr />
            <p class="mb-0">
              I am a senior at Wheaton College, IL, double majoring Biology and Studio Art. My concentrations in Studio Art are graphic design and photography. A classic liberal arts student, I am versatile, though not yet highly specialized in any area. I enjoy learning the basics of everything. Right now I like art, especially visual design, a lot more than biology. I hope to combine my knowledge in both art and sciences. I like making functional, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing designs.
            </p>
            <p class="ps"> Above all, as cheesy as it sounds, my identity is in Christ. I am a child of God, saved by God's Grace and Christ's sacrifice, not by my work. I will stop now before I preach a whole sermon.
            </p>
            <h2>What is this website?</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
              It serves two major purposes. First, obviously this is my portfolio website to show my art work. Second, this website helped me to learn the basic front-end web programming. This is the first website I built from scratch.
              <i class="ps">(Technically, I didn't build it "from scratch," I used Bootstrap, plugins, and code snippets.)</i>
              I taught by self primarily by watching <a href="https://www.lynda.com/learning-paths/Web/become-a-front-end-web-developer">Lynda.com</a>. It took about a month to have the basics done, but it is undergoing constant revisions and improvement.

                <p>I spent the first 16 years of my life in Shanghai, China and then came to the U.S. by myself as a sophomore in high school. This is my fifth year in the states. I also studied abroad in Japan for a semester, which has had a great influence on my art style and subjects. Both of my parents are artists, so the environment I grew up in made me an artist.

                  The short answer is I don't know. I constantly have new ideas. </p>
                <p class="mb-0">The long answer is:
                  First, I don't know at all what to do with my biology degree. No, not pre-med. Potentially, I am interested in bioinformatics. I kind-of know what I want to do with my art degree (read the second point). Yes, I want to combine these two, but not sure how yet. Yes, I am interested in becoming a medical illustrator, but I don't think this is my talented specialty.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                  Second, my ideal career is possibly any kind of in-house designer (graphic designer, web designer, UI/UX designer, etc.). As a liberal arts student, I think I will thrive in multi-disciplinary areas, combing skills across different industries. I am open to anything, as long as my visa allows, such as marketing, wedding photography, IT, biology research, custom services...
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                  Third, I hope to stay in the U.S. long term and become a U.S. citizen, which is my parents' dream, though they are still in China, because they believe the situations (social, political, economic, etc.) in China is really bad and is getting worse, and they want the best for me. I myself do think life in general is so much better here in the states than in China, but it is very difficult to be here long term legally, so as a practical person, I don't have much hope. To be realistic, I will try find a job in the <abbr title="Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics">STEM </abbr> field, because it gives me longer visa time, and then have side-jobs in art.
                </p>
                <p class="ps mb-0">Nonetheless, I believe I will be just fine wherever I ended up because my ultimate citizenship is God's kingdom, and my ultimate hope is in Him.

                  Initially, it was a way for me to escape the hell-like Chinese education system. After going through the competitive high school entrance exam, as soon as I entered high school, we jumped right into preparing for the college entrance exam. I felt life was meaningless.
                  At the same time, I started to get to know Christianity through my father, who was a new believer, and church that meets at our home. Then the opportunity came for me to go to a small Christian school in Maine. I seized this opportunity to escape China and to get to know more about Christianity, which I did not fully believed but was drawn to. Over the years, my faith grew slowly. In addition, I realized right away running away from my problems can not solve them. In the U.S., I face no less challenges than I did in China.

                  My first name is pronounced as “die-knee.” It is my original Chinese name that my grandpa gave me. The first character "D&#224;i" <span lang="zh-Hans"> 岱</span> is the name of a mountain in China. There is a famous ancient poem associated with it. The legend says there is a tiger on the mountain, and I was born in the year of tiger. The second character "Ni" <span lang="zh-Hans"> 妮</span> is just a name for a girl. There are total 22 strokes of my full name, and I was born on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.
                  <p class="mb-0">No, I don't want to have an "English" name because my Chinese name is easy enough for everyone to pronounce. </p>

                  THIS! I built this website and made most of the art in this portfolio in my free time, and I enjoyed it very much. In general, I like learning new things (one of my top five CliftonStrengths) by watching videos and creating my personal projects to practice the things I learned. Recently, I am into SketchUp Pro, a 3D modeling computer program for architecture and interior design. It is an "upgrade" from the game SIMS that I have been playing on my phone/iPad for five years. I also like listening to podcast when doing chores. Lately I have been listening to Timothy Keller's sermons everyday.
